1.  **`/src`**: This directory contains all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of this site (what you see in the browser) such as the site header or a page template.

2.  **`/src/assets`**: This directory holds all simple static assets as images, icons and stylesheets.

3.  **`/src/components`**: This directory contains all React components and their respective stylesheets.

4.  **`/src/constants`**: This directory keeps the constants files as redux action types or general system info used in several components.

5.  **`/src/data`**: This directory stores the file source database, including the projects presented in the portfolio and blog posts.

6.  **`/src/hooks`**: This directory contains the React hooks files.

7.  **`/src/layouts`**: This directory holds the pages layout templates.

8.  **`/src/pages`**: This is where the basic routing system works. Each file here inside is a route with their equivalent name. An `About.js` file would generate a `/about` route.

9.  **`/src/store`**: Here lays all the Redux store files: the system to manage the state shared between components.

10.  **`/src/templates`**: This directory contains the pages created by the Gatsby node API as a template replicated for a set of data.

11.  **`/static`**: This is where lays the static files that can be accessed directed by routing.

12.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

13.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

14.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where the site information is specified (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

15.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis/). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

16.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/ssr-apis/). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

17. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of npm dependencies that were installed for this project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

18. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for this project.

19. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about this project.
